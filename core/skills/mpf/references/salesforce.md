## Salesforce-Specific Interview Questions

When the project type is identified as a Salesforce implementation, ask these additional questions during the interview rounds. Integrate them naturally into the existing rounds: don't dump them all at once.

### Org & Environment Setup

- What type of Salesforce org are you working with? (Sandbox, Scratch Org, Developer Edition, Production)
- Is there an existing org with data/configuration, or are you starting fresh?
- Will you be using SFDX CLI for deployments?
- Are there multiple environments (Dev -> QA -> UAT -> Prod)? What's the promotion path?

### Scope & Solution Type

- What Salesforce clouds/products are involved? (Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Experience Cloud, Marketing Cloud, CPQ, etc.)
- What types of customization will be needed?
  - Configuration (flows, validation rules, page layouts, permission sets)
  - Custom development (Apex, LWC, Visualforce, triggers)
  - Integrations (REST/SOAP APIs, middleware, external systems)
  - Data migration (from legacy systems, CSV imports, ETL)
- Are there any AppExchange packages or managed packages involved?

### Client Deliverables

The following deliverables use industry-standard Salesforce consulting formats. Ask the user which they need:

- **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**: captures business needs, processes, and stakeholder requirements
  - From the BRD, derive: Epics, Features, User Stories with acceptance criteria
- **Solution Design Document (SDD)**: technical architecture, data model, integration design, security model
- **Data Migration Plan**: source-to-target field mapping, transformation rules, validation approach
- **Test Plan**: unit testing, UAT scripts, regression testing approach
- **Architecture Diagrams**: ERD, integration architecture, data flow, process flow
  - Generate as **HTML-based interactive visualizations** for client-ready quality
  - Use D3.js, SVG, or similar for professional output that can be exported to PNG/PDF
- **Presentations**: status updates, design reviews, go-live readiness (use pptx skill)
- **Training Materials**: end-user guides, admin guides

Note: ERD diagrams for the Salesforce data model (objects, fields, relationships) should only be generated when the user explicitly requests them.

### Data Migration

- Will Data Loader be used for data migration?
- What are the source systems?
- Are there data transformation requirements?
- What's the data volume (approximate record counts)?
- Is there a data quality/cleansing step needed before migration?

## SFDX Project Directory Structure

When the project type is Salesforce, use this directory structure. The SFDX project structure lives alongside the documentation folder:

```

## Salesforce Data Model Documentation

For Salesforce projects, `docs/technical-specs/DATA_MODEL.md` should document the Salesforce **object model** rather than SQL DDL. Adapt the structure:

- **Object Inventory** at the top: table with `Object API Name | Label | Type (Standard/Custom) | Description | Status (PLANNED/CREATED/MODIFIED)`
- **Object Definitions** grouped by functional area:
  - Each object gets a heading with a field table: `Field API Name | Label | Type | Required | Description`
  - Include validation rules, record types, and picklist values where applicable
- **Relationships** table: `Parent Object | Child Object | Relationship Type (Lookup/Master-Detail) | Field API Name`
- **ERD Diagram** (only when user requests): Mermaid erDiagram or HTML-based interactive visualization
- **Naming Conventions**: API name patterns, field prefixes, custom object suffix (__c)

## Salesforce-Specific Workflow Rules

These rules apply when the project type is Salesforce:

### Discovery & Requirements

- Guide the user through structured requirement gathering using Salesforce consulting methodology
- Produce a BRD with business processes, pain points, and desired outcomes
- Derive Epics -> Features -> User Stories from the BRD, each with acceptance criteria
- Document the Salesforce data model in `docs/technical-specs/DATA_MODEL.md` using Salesforce object notation
- Create architecture diagrams as HTML-based interactive visualizations in `deliverables/architecture/`

### Development Workflow

- Follow SFDX source-tracking workflow
- Apex classes should follow Salesforce best practices: bulkification, governor limits awareness, separation of concerns (trigger handler pattern)
- Write Apex unit tests for all custom code (aim for 85%+ coverage, as required by Salesforce)
- LWC components should follow Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) conventions

### Client Deliverables

- Generate client-facing documents in professional formats (Word docs via docx skill, presentations via pptx skill)
- Architecture diagrams should be HTML-based interactive visualizations exportable to PNG/PDF
- All deliverables stored in `deliverables/` with clear subdirectory organization

### Data Migration

- Document source-to-target field mappings in `deliverables/data-migration/field-mappings/`
- Include transformation rules, default values, and validation queries
- Track migration status in the backlog

### Data Model Changes

- **Always confirm with the user before modifying the Salesforce object model**: this includes new objects, fields, relationships, validation rules, and record types
- Document all changes in `docs/technical-specs/DATA_MODEL.md` immediately
